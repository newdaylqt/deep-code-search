guides the allowed concurrency among update operations  used as a hint for internal sizing  the table is internally partitioned to try to permit the indicated number of concurrent updates without contention  because assignment of entries to these partitions is not necessarily uniform the actual concurrency observed may vary  ideally you should choose a value to accommodate as many threads as will ever concurrently modify the table  using a significantly higher value than you need can waste space and time and a significantly lower value can lead to thread contention  but overestimates and underestimates within an order of magnitude do not usually have much noticeable impact  a value of one permits only one thread to modify the cache at a time but since read operations and cache loading computations can proceed concurrently this still yields higher concurrency than full synchronization

turn a generic message into a tuple  individual fields that are enums are converted into their string equivalents  fields that are not filled out in the protobuf are set to null unless there is a default field value in which case that is used instead
translate a nested message to a tuple  if the field is repeated it walks the list and adds each to a bag  otherwise it just adds the given one
translate a single field to a tuple  if the field is repeated it walks the list and adds each to a bag  otherwise it just adds the given one
if the given field value is an enum translate it to the enum s name as a string since pig cannot handle enums  also if the given field value is a bool translate it to  or  to avoid pig bools which can be sketchy
turn a generic message descriptor into a schema  individual fields that are enums are converted into their string equivalents
turn a nested message into a schema object  for repeated nested messages it generates a schema for a bag of tuples  for non  repeated nested messages it just generates a schema for the tuple itself
