create the proxy that does retries  adds a strict error handler to the service
gets metadata for the specified kind
perform a keys  only query
perform a keys  only plus batch gets
a normal non  hybrid query
a projection query  bypasses the session entirely
the fundamental query count operation  this doesn t appear to be implemented in the new sdk so we simulate with a keys  only query
detects integer  max value and prevents oom exceptions
loads them  note that it s possible for some loaded results to be null
create a log a message for a given path
create a key from a registered pojo entity
i have no idea what this is about it was in the old logic
easy null  safe conversion of the raw key
easy null  safe conversion of the typed key
get the kind from the class if the class has an
checks if the given type is a class that is supposed to have type parameters but doesn t  in other words if it s a really raw type
checks if the capture of sub type is a subtype of super type
returns the direct supertypes of the given type  resolves type parameters
applies capture conversion to the given type
get the relevant translator creating it if necessary
get the populator for the specified class  this requires looking up the translator for that class and then getting the populator from it
figure out if there is an index instruction for the whole class
determine if we should create a property for the method  ie
get all the persistable fields and methods declared on a class  ignores superclasses
gets the key metadata but only if this was an
gets a result using the session cache if possible
turn this into a result set
possibly pulls some values from the stuffed collection

create the full x  y  z string
root is  top level entity properties are  embedded things are higher
update a set of buckets with new values  if collisions occur resets the memcache value to null
revert a set of keys to the empty state  will loop on this several times just in case the memcache write fails  we don t want to leave the cache in a nasty state
put buckets in the cache checking for cacheability and collisions
bulk get on keys getting the raw objects
basically a list comprehension of the keys for convenience
recursively go through the class hierarchy looking for the id meta and parent meta fields
sets the key on a container from the pojo
sets the numeric id field
get the contents of the
recursively register this subclass with all the superclass translators  this works because we cache translators uniquely in the factory

add all entries in the other session to this one
gets the result possibly from the session putting it in the session if necessary  also will recursively prepare the session with

null  safe extraction of the raw key
gets the string or long id from the key as a value or null if incomplete
understands both the legacy format agzfn zvb rvbrbm uwcgcl egfcgaem and new format providing the key either way
this version goes back to life without a transaction but preserves current options  we use the session from the parent ie life before transactions
we need to make sure the parent session is the transactionless session not the session for our transaction  this gives proper transaction isolation
one attempt at executing a transaction
tests whether a set of conditions match
get the current objectify instance associated with this ref
might produce a caching version if caching is enabled
named differently so you don t accidentally use the object form
allocate num copies of the incomplete key
this is only public because it is used from the impl package  don t use this as a public api
pops context off of stack after a transaction completes  for internal housekeeping only
the datastore has a weird behavior of reordering values in a list so that indexed ones come before nonindexed ones  this can really mess up ordered lists  so if we find a heterogeneous list we need to force index everything
creates a ref from a registered pojo entity
obtain the entity value throwing an exception if the entity was not found
adds a value to the set associated with the key
this version also checks to see if we are done and we still need to call the trigger  if so it calls it
clever enough to recognize that an empty set of conditions means always
call this when a load process completes  executes anything in the batch and then executes any delayed operations
get the container object which is appropriate for the specified property  go up the chain looking for a compatible type  the first one found is the container  if nothing found throw an exception
we re just tracking statistics so we don t really need to worry about these stepping on each other  if there s a hit or miss lost no big deal
properly unwraps execution exception throwing the relevant original cause  otherwise runtime exceptions get thrown and checked exceptions get wrapped in a runtime exception
obtains the translator appropriate for this type and annotations  may be a cached translator  if not one will be discovered and cached
get the translator for a root entity class
create a translator from scratch by going through the discovery process
gets the appropriate value from the container and sets it on the appropriate field of the pojo
gets the relevant property from the container detecting alsoload collisions

iterates all bids
finds a bid by id

special case for empty  string input  returning null in non

must be called by extending classes to store and collect in one go
try the rules from the hostname domain name metadata and global scopes in this order  returns true if the url should be removed false otherwise  the value returns the value of the first matching rule be it positive or negative
this function does the replacements by iterating through all the regex patterns  it accepts a string url as input and returns the altered string  if the normalized url is an empty string the function will return null
reads the configuration file and populates a list of rules
basic filter to remove query parameters from urls so parameters that don t change the content of the page can be removed  an example would be a google analytics query parameter like utm campaign which might have several different values for a url that points to the same content  this is also called when removing attributes where the value is a hash

the relation type of the link
the type parameter when present is a hint indicating what the media type of the result of dereferencing the link should be  note that this is only a hint  for example it does not override the content  type header of a http response obtained by actually following the link  there must not be more than one type parameter in a link  value
the hreflang parameter when present is a hint indicating what the language of the result of dereferencing the link should be  note that this is only a hint  for example it does not override the content  language header of a http response obtained by actually following the link  multiple hreflang parameters on a single link  value indicate that multiple languages are available from the indicated resource
the rev parameter has been used in the past to indicate that the semantics of the relationship are in the reverse direction  that is a link from a to b with rel  x expresses the same relationship as a link from b to a with rev  x  rev is deprecated by this specification because it often confuses authors and readers  in most cases using a separate relation type is preferable
